# pyquines

Just messing around and trying to make my own python3 quines.

Definition of a quine, per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)):

> A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.

All files here should print or replicate itself when run via `python3 [scriptname]` or `python3 [scriptname] > [outputname]`

***

### quine1

Very basic quine.

***

### quine2

Using a list, list-comprehension, and ternary operator.

***

### quine3

Using a longer list, `for` loop, and list-comprehension

***

### quine4

Outputs its own sourcecode to a browser.

Run script via `python3 quine4.py` then load http://localhost:8888/. Save the resulting page and compare.

(Technically this isn't a quine because it outputs other things as well but it was a fun exercise anyway)
