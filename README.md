# pyquines

Just messing around and trying to make my own python3 quines.

Definition of a quine, per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)):

> A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.

All files here should print or replicate itself when run via `python3 [scriptname]` or `python3 [scriptname] > [outputname]`
